Space survival game

## Assets
I use the this free asset pack made by Kenny: https://kenney.nl/assets/space-shooter-redux

## Try the game
I did not make a build yet, but you can put the code in a Unity project and attach the game script to a game object. Then you can drag and drop the assets into the game script via the inspecter.

Test why github does not reference my account third time.
